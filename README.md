# SubRelay

SubRelay is a no-code solution to build automation workflows on any Substrate-based chain. The application helps users to create their off-chain automated workflows by subscribing to on-chain events through the interface. We aimed to make the app easy for average users but remain a powerful tool for advanced users. With this in mind, we designed Subrelay to be generic and flexible with any use cases. Additionally, the SubRelay can integrate with any runtime of any blockchain building on the Substrate, such as Polkadot, Kusama, and Statemine.

## Why SubRelay

From the standpoint of a developer, integrating an existing system with a blockchain is not simple. Instead of investing time developing a service to integrate with the chain, our solution will let the teams to focus on addressing their business requirements while saving time and resources. SubRelay is also available for regular users as well as developers. Without any coding experience, anyone may subscribe to on-chain events and start their automation workflows.
